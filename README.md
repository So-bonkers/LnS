### Assignment 3

 #### 1. Bilingualism and Field Work
Task - Observe at least 4 bilingual (or multilingual) people around you and record how they interchangeably use the languages when following parameters vary:
* People
* Situation
* Topic
For each of the candidate, mention the languages they speak and observe them for at least 2 hours. These
two hours may or may not be contiguous.
 #### 2. Code Mixing and Code Switching
 Scrap 100 tweets using the Twitter API where each tweet contains bilingual (English + Hindi) text that has
at least a 60:40 ratio of the two languages. If you are not comfortable with Hindi, you can choose any other
Indian Language. For each tweet, annotate the words with language i.e. each word of the tweet should be
assigned a language tag (ENG or HIN). For example:
