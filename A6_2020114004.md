### Q1. We have seen in class how solidarity and closeness are defined by kinship terms. Observe some people around you and find how pronouns or any other terms are used to express social relationships.

Ans. - Pronouns are indeed of importance in expressing the social relationships. In languages like Hindi and Marathi, with 3 levels of honorifics in pronouns, these can be used to portray power and/or solidarity between two people participating in a communication. The usage of a particular pronoun varies as to whom we are speaking to/about. The power of the person being spoken to is always taken into consideration while using the "appropriate" honorific. For example, when talking to one's father, usually, in marathi, he is referred to as "tummhi" while royalty is referred to as "aapan". In another case, when one is speaking to his/her younger sibling the pronoun used and preferred is "tu". Same is true while talking to anyone of a "lower" power status (for eg. hawker, rickshaw-driver, etc.). This is done mostly due to lack of any solidarity.

On the other hand though, using an honorific of a lower power status in some cases also implies closeness with the person in question. For example, in both Hindi and Marathi, one's Mother is called by "agg Aai" or "tu" which is a traditionally accepted pronoun for those who we view as having lower power than us. In this particular case though, the pronoun implies closeness and (sometimes) a gender differentiation (Grandmother is also called with the 1st honorific while Gradnfather is called with the 2nd honorific, same as one's father). Very commonly, the 1st honorific is also used between individuals who view themselves as equals (or firends)

Another way to distinguishing the power and solidarity is on the absence/presence of a title or a designation which is used in combination with a person's name. For example, in India, people are referred to by their last names. "Joshya" (a premature amalgamation of the surname "Joshi") may imply absence of power or a lack of solidarity or a certain degree of closeness or a combination of these 3. On the other hand, if one is called as "Joshi Saheb", it is understood that the person one is speaking to has a higher power than the speaker, which the speaker acknowledges. On the same lines, I would like to give one more example which I came upon while talking to my Grandfather. He tod me that when he was in the postal service (His name is Anand Kamthankar), everyone used to call him by name. But post his promotion as a postmaster everyone started calling him "Anandrao" which is stil used by almost everyone (post his retirement). The suffix "rao" at the end of his name, as he tells me, was a symbol of power and authority.

### Q2. Read the Bernstein’s paper on Elaborated and Restricted Codes (Posted on the Course page) and Wardaugh’s comments on the same. Explain your understanding and argue whether or not it is correct

Ans. - The relationship between language and social class is both theoretically and empirically a key issue in critical discourse studies and sociolinguistic research. A major concern in the analysis of language and social class has been how language variation acts as a marker and instrument for social and racial stratification. The paper basically discusses the findings and observation of which Bernstein conducted among working- and middle-class children. He argued for the existence of two quite distinct varieties of language use in society: the elaborated code and the restricted code, which he claimed to account for the relatively poor performance of working-class pupils in language-based subjects while they were scoring just well as their middle-class peers in mathematical subjects. 

The restricted code works better than the elaborated code in situations where there is a great deal of shared and taken for-granted knowledge in the group of speakers. This code is economical and rich, conveying a vast amount of meaning with few words, each of which has a complex set of connotations and acts like an index, pointing the hearer to a lot more information which remains unsaid. On the contrary, the elaborated code spells everything out, not because it is better, but because it is necessary so that everyone (can) understand it. It has to elaborate because the circumstances do not allow the speaker to condense. The elaborated code works well in situations where there is no prior or shared understanding and knowledge, where more thorough explanation is required. If one is saying something new to someone s/he has never met before, s/he would most certainly communicate it in the elaborated code.

On Wardhaugh's comments:
"Bernstein's Theory can be can be explained in terms of three basic concepts of language codes, class, and control. He reformulated Restricted and Elaborated codes. The restricted code “employs short, grammatically simple, and often unfinished sentences of poor syntactic form; uses few conjunctions simply and repetitively; employs little subordination; tends toward a dislocated presentation of information; is rigid and limited in the use of adjectives and adverbs, makes infrequent use of impersonal subject pronouns; confounds reasons and conclusions; uses idioms frequently and makes frequent appeals to “sympathetic circularity”"
Though the points made by Bernstein on restricted code are valid, they are not exhaustive. He aptly defines and describes the "LEXICON PREDICTION" but in doing so, the "HIGH STRUCTURAL PREDICTION" is left out in quite a few parts.
But his explanation on the elaborated codes, on the other hand, is correct : "(*the elaborated code*) makes use of accurate grammatical order and syntax to regulate what is said; uses complex sentences that employ a range of devices for conjunction and subordination; employs prepositions to show relationships of both a temporal and logical nature; shows frequent use of the pronoun I; uses with care a wide range of adjectives and adverbs; is likely to arise in a social relationship which raises the tension in its members to select from their linguistic resources a verbal arrangement which closely fits specific referents"

### Q3. Based on the readings answer the following questions in the Indian context:

1. Would mother tongue as a medium of instruction work better?
2. Is English the right choice as a medium of education?
3. Does it widen the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged?

Ans. -
Since the medium of instruction in education is something whose effectiveness depends upon the subject being taught, there is room for some subjectivity and hence some confusion might arise due to this. To avoid this confusion, We shall keep our discussion limited to those subjects which are not directly language related. For the language-specific subjects however, the medium of instruction should be in that language itself, is something we shall agree on before continuing this elaboration due to obvious reasons.

1. India has a very rich ethnic and linguistic diversity. In today's scenario, it is not practical to exclusively find and educate children belonging to only one speech community. In such case, there is no single mother tongue, which necessitates the introduction of a 3rd language which either everyone knows or has to learn because of it's indispenibility. Still, if we do consider a group of children who belong to just one linguistic group, in the context of the paper, one would say that mother tongue as a medium of instruction would work better. There are a few reasons as to why I reached this conclusion:
* Every person speaking the same language makes it easier to effectively communicate.
* In the paper as well, Bernstein pointed out that in the case of restricted code (structural prediction), the speech is played out against a backdrop of assumptions common to the speakers, against a set of closely shared interests and identifications, against a system of shared expectations; in short, it presupposes a local cultural identity which reduces the need for the speakers to elaborate their intent verbally and to make it explicit
* The extent to which the intent of the other person may be taken for granted, the more likely that the structure of the speech will be simplified and the vocabulary drawn from the narrow range. This point very aptly suits the premise of education as the topic of discussion is pre-set. For example, consider the following sentence as uttered by an instructor "Is pe schumaker laga do" which literally traslates to "put schumaker on this". But to a student, the meaning conveyed is "Apply the schumaker's formula for this particular problem/question."

Putting all this together, an observer might be struck by the fact that the speech in these social relationships was fast, fluent, with reduced articulatory clues, the meanings might be discontinuous, dislocated, condensed and local, but the quantity of speech might not be affected.

2. As I briefly explained in the 1st part, no region in India can practically have an unadulterated group of individuals with respect to their linguistic identity. In such case, the ideal choice would be to use a medium of language which either everyone knows or has no association with a regional linguistic majority or is ultimately indispensible. In India's case, the only language satisfying these conditions is English. Given its history of being associated with the colonisers which made it compulsory to use English as a medium of communication at least for all official purposes, it's importance grew. With this context in mind, it also provided the Indians (which were split linguistically to the degree that often times the communication was unintelligible) with a common language in which they could communicate effectively. Thus, in my opinion, using English as a medium of instruction for education is, while not "right", but is the best choice. It would enable the individuals to communicate in a way where the content of speech is more likely than earlier (but not necessarily) is concrete, narrative and descriptive rather than analytial or abstract.

3. Quite obviously, it *does* widen the gap between the advantaged and the diadvantaged. Please note that here the advantaged and the disadvantaged refers to indivduals which do and which do not prevously have a knowledge of the language in question (i.e. English) respectively. As a reference to the paper, "The point I want to make is that a restricted code is available to all members of society as the social conditions which generate it are universal. But it may be that a considerable section of our society has access only to this code by virtue of the implications of class background. I am suggesting that there is relatively high probability of finding children limited to this code among sections of the lower working-class population. On this argument, the general form of their speech is not substandard English but is related to and shares a similar social origin with the restricted code I have just outlined. It is a special case-- a case where children can use one and only one speech system. What this code makes relevant to them, the learning generated by apparently spontaneous acts of speech, is not appropriate for their formal educational experience. But only from this point of view is it inappropriate". 

While referring to the first point, I would also like to point out that as compared to to the "advantaged", the "disadvantaged" are at an even greater disadvantage because they are analogous to an outsider to this codification of the language. In fact, while observing these relationships, these "disadvantaged" may find themselves struck by the following : 
* The observer would be eavesdropping on inclusive relationships, and so he would be struck by the measure of his own exclusion. He might have difficulty at first in following the speech as it would tend to be fast, fluent, relatively unpaused, and so the articulatory clues would be reduced.
* On the other hand, if he could write down the sequences, he might be surprised to find that they would be relatively impersonal. If intent does not have to be verbalized and made explicit, if much can be assumed and taken for granted, there is no need to use a level of verbal planning which requires careful selection and fine discriminations.
* might notice the vitality of the speech and this vitality would serve an important function. The burden of changes in meaning would be carried through the extraverbal component of the communication. The 'how' of the communication would be important rather than the 'what.' 
* He might also notice that the speech sequences, from his point of view,  would tend to be dislocated--disjunctive. There might well be logical gaps in the flow of meaning. The speakers would not be worried because they could take much for granted. The connecting devices in the speech might not clarify the logical organization of meaning.
