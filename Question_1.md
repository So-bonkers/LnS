# Question 1 

## Observing bilingual people

For this task, I sat in a restaurant with my friends and noticed how often the people around me use languages (English and Hindi in this case)
interchangibly. The people I decided to base this assignment on were -
* Owner of the restaurant (Receptionist)
* Waiter 
* Customers

## Under Observation -
### Owner -

1. #### Languages Spoken - 
*  Hindi
*  English
*  Gujarati

2. #### People -

3. #### Situation -

4. #### Topic -
*  The choice of language use greatly depends on the topic being discussed. Note that here the conversation referred to is the one between the owner and a customer
