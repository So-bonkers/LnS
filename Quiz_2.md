1. Labov's study on Martha's Vineyard is a groundbreaking discovery in the field of sociolinguistics. It was simple as well as revolutionary, 
the way which Labov chose to approach this. He sought to probe deeply into the correlation between the different local dialects based on social influence. The rich ethnicity of 
the Vineyard was also an aiding factor that gave him the leeway to study more about the region. The reason why this study is now reverred is that it was one of the first ones 
which went beyond just making simple generalized observations pertaining to the differences in speech communities concerning a certain linguistic variable. It attempted a first 
scientific study of social factors behind the sound change and language alteration. It is now widely believed that the robust correspondence between linguistic facts, social 
factors, and speaker's attitude set the foundations for Variationist Sociolinguistics.

2. A significant feature of Martha's Vineyard study was a comparison of the centralized and decentralized variants among speakers of different ages.
