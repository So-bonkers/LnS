# Question 1 

## Observing bilingual people

For this task, I sat in a restaurant with my friends and noticed how often the people around me use languages (English and Hindi in this case)
interchangibly. The people I decided to base this assignment on were -
 * Owner of the restaurant (Receptionist)
 * Waiter 
 * Customers
 * Friends

---

## Under Observation -
### Owner -

1. #### Languages Spoken - 
 *  Hindi
 *  English
 *  Gujarati

2. #### People - 
 * Owner converses with the customers in both Hindi and English as well as in a codemixed manner. 
 * The response and the language in which the owner replies to a query also depends on the language in which the query was made by the customer. 
 * Though he tries to reply in the same language, he often mixes the two languages while replying in English. For example - "OK thank you fir zaroor aiyega", "Nahi sir ye hotel expensive nahi hain, balki ekdum moderately-priced hain"  or "Ji, ji kaunse delivery location pe bhejna hai delivery boy ko?" 
 * This difference of rich (active) bilingualism is only found in interaction with the customers.
 * While talking to the restaurant staff, the owner uses only Hindi. Hindi is also preferred in usage with the "regular customers".
 * The owner seems to recognise them and prefers to use a less formal tone (and in this case, language too) with these customers.

3. #### Situation - 
 * His speech seems to continue in the same language throughout a given situation. 
 * But for different situations, the language changes accordingly. For example, while conversing with the hotel staff, the medium of conversation remains mostly Hindi and occasionally does shift to English. But when he talks to his cashier (a family member), he chooses to use Gujarati. 

4. #### Topic -
 *  The choice of language use greatly depends on the topic being discussed. Note that here the conversation referred to is the one between the owner and a customer
 *  If the topic being talked about is food, the owner predominantly uses English but speaks Hindi as well
 *  On the other hand, if the topic being discussed is unrelated to the profession (for example, cricket and IPL), he tends to stick to Hindi.

### Waiter - 

1. #### Languages Spoken - 
 * Hindi
 * English
 * Marathi

2. #### People - 
 * This was the single most distinct characteristic of the waiter was compared to others. 
 * He tends to reply in the language in which customer places an order (i.e. English, Hindi or Marathi)
 * There was also an instance when a customer said something in Tamil , a language that the waiter did not understand. To  this, he replied with the English "I' sorry sir, I didn't understand you"

3. #### Situation - 
 * Though (as mentioned above) the waiter replies to a customer in which he is spoken to (if he knows the language), this is where variety ends.
 * He speaks with the owner and cashier both in Hindi.
 * While repeating the order to the kitchen staff, he uses Marathi language.

4. #### Topic - 
   The interaction of the waiter with customers seem to be limited to the topic of food and his preference of language use is as mentioned above.

### Customers - 

1. #### Languages Used - 
* English
* Hindi
* (Possibly) A 3rd language (it isn't feasible to list all the languages a collective of customers speak as the set also includes mother tongues, which may or may not be the same for all)  

2.  ### People - 
* Among their respective social groups, they tend to stick to any one language (English or Hindi)
* While placing order (with waiter), customers prefer to use a codemixed version of English and Hindi 
* When the conversation occurs with the owner of the store, Hindi is the most preferred lanugage. 

3.  ### Situation - 
* Restaurant sees customers (essentially a group of people) assembling for various reasons
* People coming simply to eat; These groups usually have idle discussions which take place majorly in Hindi
* There were also groups spotted which came for work/ business lunch/ etc. These groups generally have a fixed agenda for the meeting and language preferred is predominantly English.
* People who speak a third common language mostly prefer to converse in that language alone (atleast with each other). But this speech may or may not contain borrowed words from a different language and hence is oftenfound to be codemixed in nature.

4.  ### Topic - 
It is difficult to generalise (if not impossible) the distinction in speech on the basis of topics because the topics themselves (in this context) are very vague. [Also Observer's Dilemma]

### Friends

1. #### Languages used - 
* As the bulk of my friends (with whom I went to this restaurant) are all multilingual with only English as our commonly understood language, we prefer to communicate in English.

2. ### People - 
* I observed that our group maintained a Hindi conversation among ourselves (while choosing the order and idle chat), but ordered in English. 
* Codemixing (Hindi and English) was not uncommon as the breadth of the topics discussed mainly included Academia, which necessitated the use of technical terms.
* Example - ".... Haa but phir bhi C.S-1 ka syllabus mere liye jyaada easy tha, C.S-2 toh was very tough"

3. ### Situation and Topic - 
* As demonstrated by the above example, codemixing was more common in the situations where the usage of the appropriate word (and the absence of a word with corresponding meaning in the other language) is necessary.
* While interacting with others (excluding the above situation), Hindi was more preffered.
* There was also an instance where impersonation of few celebrities followed. Here, the language used (for the reported speech) was the same as the one used in the original dialogue. Example - "I am inevitable!"
