For Immediate Nuclear Family, we notice that the distiction between elder and younger siblings in English has to be preceded by a prefix while in Hindi and Marathi there exists
a single term for each of these relations. 

For Immediate Joint Family as well as Extended Family, we see the the English Term is 'Cousin' is in fact an umbrella term which in Hindi and Marathi has different names based on not only gender but the relation with the nearest Immediate Nuclear Family. 

A factor to observe in Step Family is for  the term 'Cousin' while in Hindi the first word defining the relation is changes based on the gender of the person talking to (age is also a factor influencing this word usage), in Marathiit remains the same and thus thus defines all the relations in that paradigm. For example, while (in the step-family) Father and Brother have different 1st words (i.e sautele and sautela resp.) the corresponding terms for both Sister and Mother are (Sauteli). But for all 4 relations, the term in Marathi remains common (i.e. Saavatra)

Though many colours as defined in English have direct counterparts in both the other languages, some tertiary colors have either derived names(from 2 or more primary colors' names) or with reference to an object which is commonly known to have that particular color.

Consider the color 'Pink'. In Marathi and Hindi, the name is 'Gulabi' which is derived from 'Gulab' or 'Rose'. Similar is the case of the color 'Purple' where while Marathi has a separate term, Hindi uses the term 'Baingani' which literaly translates to 'like an eggplant' which refers to its color.

Consider 'Brown'. Because of a lack of a pre-existing word in the language, Hindi directly transliterates the word (while Marathi has another term defining it.) Similar is the case with the color 'Cyan'.

In some colors like 'Turquoise' with no corresponding unique name in Hindi and Marathi, a combination of other pre-existing colors is used like 'Hara-Neela' or 'green-blue'

In some cases, the name of the color itself originates from a pre-existing object or an idea. This nomenclature is common for all the 3 languages and also the commodity with which the inspiration of the color was taken from is the same. (Ex. 'Golden' color)

While English has a different name pertaining to each shade of a color . See above example for shades of red. For a Hindi or Marathi speaker, only one umbrella term 'Laal' exists which he/she uses everywhere.

Since the topic chosen was cuisine, the words for indiviual food item varied with respect to their place of origin as well as their popularity. Apt examples of these would be Sandwich and burger, which are of English origin and also populised by them, have extended to other languages as well. Similarly Pizza (Which has its origin in Italy, an Italian speaking country) has been popularised used as such worldwide. Now for words like 'Bread' which means - 'a dough preparation from cereals which is heated' has a very narrow meaning in English (where the definition is from) but in India, where Hindi and English are spoken, has a varied assortment which is fundamentally different from each other but still is true to the definiton. Hence, even if they have different names in two languages (or completely exclusive to a single language), it is referred to as only 'Bread' in English. Similar is the case with soup.

For the final example, 'Sweet bread' which is also called 'Yellow Flatbread' in English, actually has its origins in Marathi and is pronounced so mainly because native speakers of English cannot pronounce the sound 'ळ'.
