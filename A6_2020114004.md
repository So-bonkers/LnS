### Q3. Based on the readings answer the following questions in the Indian context:

1. Would mother tongue as a medium of instruction work better?
2. Is English the right choice as a medium of education?
3. Does it widen the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged?

Ans. -
Since the medium of instruction in education is something whose effectiveness depends upon the subject being taught, there is room for some subjectivity and hence some confusion might arise due to this. To avoid this confusion, We shall keep our discussion limited to those subjects which are not directly language related. For the language-specific subjects however, the medium of instruction should be in that language itself, is something we shall agree on before continuing this elaboration due to obvious reasons.

1. India has a very rich ethnic and linguistic diversity. In today's scenario, it is not practical to exclusively find and educate children belonging to only one speech community. In such case, there is no single mother tongue, which necessitates the introduction of a 3rd language which either everyone knows or has to learn because of it's indispenibility. Still, if we do consider a group of children who belong to just one linguistic group, in the context of the paper, one would say that mother tongue as a medium of instruction would work better. There are a few reasons as to why I reached this conclusion:
* Every person speaking the same language makes it easier to effectively communicate.
* In the paper as well, Bernstein pointed out that in the case of restricted code (structural prediction), the speech is played out against a backdrop of assumptions common to the speakers, against a set of closely shared interests and identifications, against a system of shared expectations; in short, it presupposes a local cultural identity which reduces the need for the speakers to elaborate their intent verbally and to make it explicit
* The extent to which the intent of the other person may be taken for granted, the more likely that the structure of the speech will be simplified and the vocabulary drawn from the narrow range. This point very aptly suits the premise of education as the topic of discussion is pre-set. For example, consider the following sentence as uttered by an instructor "Is pe schumaker laga do" which literally traslates to "put schumaker on this". But to a student, the meaning conveyed is "Apply the schumaker's formula for this particular problem/question."

Putting all this together, an observer might be struck by the fact that the speech in these social relationships was fast, fluent, with reduced articulatory clues, the meanings might be discontinuous, dislocated, condensed and local, but the quantity of speech might not be affected.

2. As I briefly explained in the 1st part, no region in India can practically have an unadulterated group of individuals with respect to their linguistic identity. In such case, the ideal choice would be to use a medium of language which either everyone knows or has no association with a regional linguistic majority or is ultimately indispensible. In India's case, the only language satisfying these conditions is English. Given its history of being associated with the colonisers which made it compulsory to use English as a medium of communication at least for all official purposes, it's importance grew. With this context in mind, it also provided the Indians (which were split linguistically to the degree that often times the communication was unintelligible) with a common language in which they could communicate effectively. Thus, in my opinion, using English as a medium of instruction for education is, while not "right", but is the best choice. It would enable the individuals to communicate in a way where the content of speech is more likely than earlier (but not necessarily) is concrete, narrative and descriptive rather than analytial or abstract.

3. Quite obviously, it *does* widen the gap between the advantaged and the diadvantaged. Please note that here the advantaged and the disadvantaged refers to indivduals which do and which do not prevously have a knowledge of the language in question (i.e. English) respectively. As a reference to the paper, "The point I want to make is that a restricted code is available to all members of society as the social conditions which generate it are universal. But it may be that a considerable section of our society has access only to this code by virtue of the implications of class background. I am suggesting that there is relatively high probability of finding children limited to this code among sections of the lower working-class population. On this argument, the general form of their speech is not substandard English but is related to and shares a similar social origin with the restricted code I have just outlined. It is a special case-- a case where children can use one and only one speech system. What this code makes relevant to them, the learning generated by apparently spontaneous acts of speech, is not appropriate for their formal educational experience. But only from this point of view is it inappropriate". 

While referring to the first point, I would also like to point out that as compared to to the "advantaged", the "disadvantaged" are at an even greater disadvantage because they are analogous to an outsider to this codification of the language. In fact, while observing these relationships, these "disadvantaged" may find themselves struck by the following : 
* The observer would be eavesdropping on inclusive relationships, and so he would be struck by the measure of his own exclusion. He might have difficulty at first in following the speech as it would tend to be fast, fluent, relatively unpaused, and so the articulatory clues would be reduced.
* On the other hand, if he could write down the sequences, he might be surprised to find that they would be relatively impersonal. If intent does not have to be verbalized and made explicit, if much can be assumed and taken for granted, there is no need to use a level of verbal planning which requires careful selection and fine discriminations.
* might notice the vitality of the speech and this vitality would serve an important function. The burden of changes in meaning would be carried through the extraverbal component of the communication. The 'how' of the communication would be important rather than the 'what.' 
* He might also notice that the speech sequences, from his point of view,  would tend to be dislocated--disjunctive. There might well be logical gaps in the flow of meaning. The speakers would not be worried because they could take much for granted. The connecting devices in the speech might not clarify the logical organization of meaning.
