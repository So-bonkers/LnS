### Project - Prevalence of Linguistic Variable in any 3 social groups
#### Team Sociolite

### Literature Survey
The papers chosen as a reference for these projects were:
* Learning and Evolutionary Constraints on Linguistic Variability - Alessandra Chiera, Ines Adornetti, Francesco Ferretti
* Chance as Cause of Language Variation and Change - Ron Butters

Our project intends to systematically categorise people who pronounce the chosen linguistic variable (i.e the consonants 'क्ष' and 'ज्ञ') into 3 social categories. 
The papers chosen throw a light on the way this categorisation takes place. What really interested us was the chaos theory in the 2nd paper. 

"Languages  are  under  powerful  selection  pressure  to  fit  children’s  likely  guesses, because children are the vehicle by which a language gets reproduced. 
Languages have had to adapt to children’s spontaneous assumptions about communication, learning, social interaction, and even symbolic reference, because children are the only game in town. It turns out that in a curious sort of inversion of our intuitions about this prob-lem, languages need children more than children need languages. "

In our survey, we intend on extending this outlook to not only the social factor that is age, but also the socio-economic status of the speaker as well the impact of regional proximity and the feeling of belongingness (mother-tongue) as a dominating factor influencing the speaker to choose one variety (of the linguistic variable) to the other.
