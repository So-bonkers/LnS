# Question 1 

## Observing bilingual people

For this task, I sat in a restaurant with my friends and noticed how often the people around me use languages (English and Hindi in this case)
interchangibly. The people I decided to base this assignment on were -
* Owner of the restaurant (Receptionist)
* Waiter 
* Customers
* Friends

---

## Under Observation -
### Owner -

1. #### Languages Spoken - 
*  Hindi
*  English

2. #### People - 
* Owner converses with the customers in both Hindi and English as well as in a codemixed manner. The response and the language in which the owner replies to a query also depends on the language in which the query was made by the customer. Though he tries to reply in the same language, he often mixes the two languages while replying in English. For example - "OK thank you fir zaroor aiyega", "Nahi sir ye hotel expensive nahi hain, balki ekdum moderately-priced hain"  or "Ji, ji kaunse delivery location pe bhejna hai delivery boy ko?" This difference of rich (active) bilingualism is only found in interaction with the customers. While talking to the restaurant staff, the owner uses only Hindi. Hindi is also preferred in usage with the "regular customers". The owner seems to recognise them and prefers to use a less formal tone (and in this case, language too) with these customers.
